# PV-Greenhouse-Integration-Scenarios

This repository builds on inwe-boku/PV-Greenhouse-Integration and adds functionality:

* to extend observed electricity demand and PV electricity generation time series by means of a stacking regression ensemble
* to generate and analyse scenarios based on different climate years, cost assumptions and load shifting regimes
